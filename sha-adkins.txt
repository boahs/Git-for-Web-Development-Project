    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. Okay first we'll need to fork the repository we're wanting to make changes to. After we've done that we'll need to add our team leader as the collaborator. Now we'll open up gitbash, and move into the directory we're wanting to save this locally to. cd... mkdir... Now back onto the github page, we'll have to hit "code" (which use to be "CLONE") and copy the URL. Back in the terminal we'll input the following : git clone <url>. Now we'll need to make a branch to start making our edits to. So we'll do that by inputting the following - git checkout -b 'Our-Name'. Once we've made our edits we'll need to commit by inputting the following - git commit -m 'message' then we'll have to push it. So we'll input the following - git push origin 'Our-Name'. Now we'll open the repository again and hit "Create pull request" while under our branch we made. Once we're there we'll hit "compare" if all commits that were pushed is OKAY the team leader will merge your changes, and it'll be live.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? The line element won't start on a new line, and wil only occupy the width it requires. The block element will start on a new line, and occupy the FULL width available, and we can set the width and height values.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? A fixed positon. It'll be positioned relative to the nearest ancestor element. 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? We use a block element, and change the width accordingly 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default <li> , <ol>, <p> | <button> <img> | <width>  
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    It's like looking at a house. The box model will be all the HTML elements, and the CSS box model will be what wraps around that specific HTML. and to make all elements respect the width given to them we'll simply add the width: property. It'll be applied to all elements except the inline elements , and table rows.
